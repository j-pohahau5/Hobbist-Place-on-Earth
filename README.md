# Getting Started 
💃

Create a Interactive MERN Stack Single-Page Application with the following features:


✅Use React for the front end.

✅Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.

✅Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.

✅Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.

✅Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

✅Have a polished UI.

✅Be responsive.

✅Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

✅Include authentication (JWT).

✅Protect sensitive API key information on the server.

✅Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, and so on).

✅Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

# Code snippets
🔦
➡️ Models:

user as example:

Model associations / relationships

user has

many hobbies
many likes
many comments

The user schema defines a user object with the following fields:

username: A required string that is unique and trimmed.

email: A required string that is unique and matches an email address pattern.

password: A required string with a minimum length of 5 characters.

hobbies: An array of object IDs referencing Hobby objects.

comments: An array of object IDs referencing Comment objects.

categories: An array of object IDs referencing Category objects.

➡️ Type-defs:

The typeDef.js file in our schema defines the GraphQL schema for an application that involves users, categories, hobbies, and comments.

It uses the gql function from apollo-server-express to define the schema using GraphQL's type definition language.

The schema includes four main types: User, Category, Comment, and Hobby. Each of these types has a set of fields that define the data that can be queried or mutated.

The Query type defines the queries that can be executed to retrieve data from the application. The available queries include users, user, categories, comments, category, hobbies, hobby, and me.

The Mutation type defines the mutations that can be executed to modify data in the application. There are 16 available mutations, SUCH AS

➡️ Tailwindscss & Sweetalert2 :

This code snippet displayed is using the withSwal higher-order component (HOC) from the react-sweetalert2 library.

Higher-order components are functions that take a component and return a new component with additional functionality. withSwal is a HOC that adds SweetAlert2 functionality to a component. 

WE USED REACT-SWEETALERT2 "V.0.5.2" IN ORDER TO GET alerts RENDERed ON the client side of OUR REACT APP 17.0.1 . 

THE REACT APP GETS IMPORTED AT THE TOP OF THE JS PAGE THAT IT GETS USED ON. THE AWAIT SWAL THEN TELLS THE CODE ONCE THIS GETS REMOVED, WAIT A MOMENT (TIMER) AND THEN SAY SUCCESSFULLY DELETED. 
 
OUR PAGE INCLUDES: 
"ADD COMMENT"
"ADD CATEGORIES"
"DELETE COMMENTS"
"DELETE CATEGORIES"
